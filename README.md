This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "Get Started" at https://bookdown.org/ for how to compile this example.  You should edit the author field of the `index.Rmd` file and provide a link to your personal web page. Use the first three chapters (`01-MLRchap01.Rmd`, `02-MLRchap02.Rmd`, and `03-MLRchap03.Rmd`) as examples for completing the remaining two chapters (`04-MLRchap04.Rmd`, and `05-MLRchap05.Rmd`). Your completed book should look similar to (https://stat-ata-asu.github.io/MultipleAndLogisticRegression/).
